## Description
In this project I have written a program in the C programming language to calculate the [SHA512](https://www.nist.gov/publications/secure-hash-standard) value of an input file, using no external libaries only the C standard libary.

## Compilation
Prerequisites for Compilation
----------------------------- 
Prerequisites
- Ubuntu/Debian 

Source Code for Compilation
-----------------------------
- `git clone https://github.com/MarkReillyGMIT/TheoryOfAlgorithmsProject`
- `cd <compilation directory>`
-  Run `make test` this will run tests on any .txt file in the current directory and output sha512 value of the file and compare it to the correct sha512 value using sha512sum.

## Explanation
#### What the SHA512 algorithm is and why it is important.

## Questions and Answers:
#### Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?

#### Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?

#### How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?
